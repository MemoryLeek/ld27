# Ludum Dare #27

This is the repo we will use during Ludum Dare 27.
You'll be able to see our progress and all changes here in real time during the event.

As usual we will provide binaries for Linux and Windows when the compo is over,
but you are always welcome to build the source yourself.

## Engine

As you can see we have already started working on the basics like drawing and input.
We usually do this so that we can start doing the fun bits as soon as the theme is announced.
This will also give us some more time to finish, since the theme is announced at 03:00 on Saturday Swedish time
and we all have work on Monday. :)
